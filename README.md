scraping SIA daily news site

# Goal: Create a NLP processor that extracts article details to create a standardized log

**Step 1: scrap the text from articles** [complete] *still need to add ability for date range search*

**Step 2: categorize articles with high confidence**
Not sure where to start with this one. Will need to learn more about machine learning. Will dive in when I get the chance.

**Step 3: create another deep learning algorithm that can extract details from the article**
TBD. Perhaps step 2 may be sufficient enough. 

# Status as of Aug 8, 2018:
The scraper can go through articles and print the text to a file. Also added ability to focus special keywords.
